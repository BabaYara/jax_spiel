# Narrative Rubric Log

- **Date:** \today
- **Focus:** Policy and value narrative alignment with plan milestone 3.
- **Outcome:** Incorporated inline expressions for $J(\theta)$, $\nabla_\theta J(\theta)$, $v^{\pi}(s)$, and $q^{\pi}(s, a)$ to emphasize differentiable evaluation stories. Added table-driven figure linking milestones to formulas for clearer reviewer checkpoints.
- **Next Steps:** Validate that future TensorState examples demonstrate the same recursion in executable tutorials and extend logs with empirical traces once JAX policies are prototyped.
