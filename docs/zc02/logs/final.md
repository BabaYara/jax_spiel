# Final Verification Log

- **Date:** \today
- **Rubric Outcomes:**
  - Build pipeline **failed** because `pythontex` and `latexmk` are unavailable in the environment.
  - Iteration test suite **blocked** during collection; `sympy` dependency missing for payoff tests.
- **Regression Notes:**
  - Document compilation cannot be validated until TeX toolchain (`pythontex`, `latexmk`) is installed.
  - Test target `pytest -m "zc02"` should include SymPy in the environment or adjust tests to avoid the dependency.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Install the TeX toolchain and re-run the four latexmk variants after verifying availability.
  - Provide the required Python dependencies before rerunning the zc02 marker tests.
