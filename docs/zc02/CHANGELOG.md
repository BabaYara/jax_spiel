# zc02 Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Final verification log capturing build and test blockers for the zc02 release stream.

### Verification Summary
- `pythontex docs/zc_02.tex` — command not available in execution environment.
- `latexmk -pdf` — command not available in execution environment.
- `latexmk -pdf -quiet` — command not available in execution environment.
- `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode` — command not available in execution environment.
- `pytest -m "zc02"` — collection failed: missing `sympy` module required by `tests/zc02/test_payoffs.py`.

### Regression Notes
- Install TeX tooling and SymPy before tagging the final `zc02` release to avoid blocking verification.
